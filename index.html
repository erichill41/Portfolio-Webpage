            <h1>Hello! My name is Eric Hill.</h1>
            <p>I am currently a software engineering student at Thinkful, living near Denver, Colorado. I want to introduce myself so you
            can get a glance at who I am; both on professional level, and to show some
            of what I like to do outside of working with code! On my webpage you'll find more information about me, a glance at some of
            the projects I have been working on, and several different ways to reach me.</p>
            <p>I haven't always been passionate about writing code, I have several friends close to me who are developers now but I didn't
            know much about what they did. Working in sales at Dell Technologies was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the 
            technical side of the equipment we use. This fueled my newfound passion for engineering, leading to the career change I am going
            through, and I couldn't be happier with my decision!</p>

      <!-- About Me Section -->

      <section id="About-Me" class="dark-background">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="group">  
          <div class="item-double">
            <p>I started my career in sales after earning a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing from the University of Central Oklahoma. 
            With a background in business and technology sales, I aim to bridge the gap of disconnect between technical teams and the 
            business management side of things in small-medium businesses. In my short time as a web development student, I have really grown a passion
            for seeing just how the code we write impacts the programs we use on a daily basis. As a former collegiate athlete, I love being able to 
            work in a team and collaborate with other developers to get unique perspectives and build immersive programs.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of learning to develop software I'm a pretty active person, and living in Colorado certainly has its perks for being active! 
            Some of my favorite things to do include: hockey, golf, general fitness, rock climbing, cycling, and exploring all that Colorado has to offer.</p>

            <h3>Local Library Project</h3>
            <p>The local library project works to create a library for a local neighborhood using JavaScript that gives users
            information about available books to checkout and most popular authors/books/genres. I built this to continue
            my practice of using higher order functions and supply neighborhoods with a way to track books.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Skills Used: JavaScript, higher order functions.</li>

            <h3>Decoder Ring Project</h3>
            <p>The Decoder Ring Project works to encode and decode messages using JavaScript functions. It's useful for anyone wanting to send
            their friend an encrypted message, or to decode a message that was received. I built this to further solidify skills in JavaScript
            and working with complex algorithms, as well as giving users a fun way to encrypt messages.</p>
            <ul>
