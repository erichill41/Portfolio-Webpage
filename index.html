            <h1>Hello! My name is Eric Hill.</h1>
            <p>I want to introduce myself so you and others can get to know more about me. Both on professional level, and to show some
            of what I like to do outside of working with code! On my webpage you'll find more information about me, a glance at some of
            the projects I have been working on, and several different ways to reach me.</p>
            <p>I haven't always been passionate about writing code, I have several friends close to me who are developers now but I didn't
            know much about what they did. Working in sales at Dell Technologies was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the 
            technical side of the equipment we use. This fueled my newfound passion for engineering, leading to the career change I am going
            through, and I couldn't be happier with my decision!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="group">  
          <div class="item-double">
            <p>I started my career in sales after earning a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing from the University of Central Oklahoma. 
            With a background in business and technology sales, I aim to bridge the gap of disconnect between technical teams and the 
            business management side of things in small-medium businesses. My ability to problem solve, passion for efficiency, and 
            working as a team are the reasons I feel confident in making this career change.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of learning to develop software I'm a pretty active person, and living in Colorado certainly has its perks for being active! 
            Some of my favorite things to do include: hockey, golf, general fitness, rock climbing, cycling, and exploring all that Colorado has to offer.</p>
